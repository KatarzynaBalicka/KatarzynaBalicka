- 👋 Hi, I’m @KatarzynaBalicka
- 👀 I’m interested in graphics design on many levels starting from webpages going all the way to game characters (although still have a bit of a way to go).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JS (you know, the basics) and some graphic software like Affinity Designer and Clip Paint Studio.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some projects that would expand more of the two fields that I'm learning (and in that would be connected to game industry that would be great).
- 📫 How to reach me?
You can look for my graphics works on [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/ryuniko), although this portofolio is just staring up.
As for webpages designs like I've said. Learning. Hopefully will be able to put something her ein near future.
